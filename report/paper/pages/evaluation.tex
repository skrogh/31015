\section{Evaluation}\label{sec:evaluation}
We have conducted a stability and step response test for our implementation and compared the results with an identical test of
Hermansen's implementation when using the potentiometer and IR proximity sensor as a position reference. These comparisons can be
seen in figure~\ref{fig:pottest} and~\ref{fig:irtest} respectively. Note that on all plots, the reference position measured from the
potentiometer is given in radians. This means that it does not line up with the estimated position, which is measured in meters above
the horizontal position of the arm, when the angle is not zero. It should also be noted that we have added a lowpass filter to the
potentiometer to counter switching noise from commutation in the motor,
explaining the difference in noise level between Hermansen's implementation here and in his thesis.

		rise time and overshoot is still low because of the bandwidth provided by the accelerometer. The arm never moves more than
		1cm from the set point.}

\end{figure}

It is also interesting to see how low the update rate for the position reference can be set, since many available sensors such as GPS 
have very slow update rates. Figure~\ref{fig:pot1hztest} shows how well our implementation handles position reference updates at
1Hz using the potentiometer.

	range. The risetime and overshoot is still small and the arm never wanders more than 1cm from the set point.}

\end{figure}


The performance of the system using the ultrasound proximity sensor for positional updates can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:ultratest}.
It is advantageous to use the ultrasound sensor instead of the IR sensor because the IR sensor can be blinded by glare and is almost
unusable in outdoor conditions in addition to the bad accuracy of its measurements arising from the quantization of measurements in
\(\sim\)2cm steps (and rising for objects further away). The ultrasound sensor
does not have these problems. Furthermore, the ultrasound sensors usually have a
larger range, 4cm to 3m for the model we use, and calibration is easy as the
speed of sound is relatively constant. However, it is clear that the noise
which we attempted to reduce using the gating filter, has not been completely eliminated.
For an airborne multirotor it would seem that the ultrasound proximity sensor is the best choice for near earth altitude estimation.
