\section{Implementation}\label{sec:implemenation}
Our implementation consists of a realtime Linux desktop machine, handling the
localisation and control logic, and a microcontroller positioned on the arm. The microcontroller handles measurements from the MEMs accelerometer and rate gyroscope as well as the ultrasound
distance sensor. The IR distance sensor is connected directly to the desktop machine through a National Instruments ADC/DAC, as is the 
potentiometer at the base of the arm which is used for reference measurements.

We have made several changes to the original setup by Hermansen. The most important of these are

\begin{itemize}
		\item A complete overhaul of the communications subsystem in order to support sending accelerometer, rate gyroscope and 
			distance measurements at 1kHz and avoid intermittent transmission errors. 
		\item The original complementary filter has been replaced by a static kalman filter for state estimation and a linear 
			quadratic regulator (LQR)\cite{Hendricks2008} for motor command control.
			\item The addition of an ultrasound proximity sensor for distance measurements.
\end{itemize}

The microcontroller on the arm is an ARM\textregistered Cortex\(^{\text{TM}}\)
M4F mounted on a Tiva\(^{\text{TM}}\) Launchpad development board from Texas Instruments.
It is connected to an InvenSense MPU9150 on which the MEMs accelerometer and
rate gyroscope resides. It is also connected to a Parallax Ping))) ultrasonic distance sensor. The
test setup can be seen in figure~\ref{fig:labsetup}

\subsection{Communications subsystem}\label{sec:comms}
The Tiva Launcpad recieves measurements from the accelerometer, rate gyroscope and ultrasound sensor. The accelerometer and 
rate gyroscope is sampled at 1kHz, while the ultrasound sensor has a varying sample rate that depends on the distance to the nearest
object.
It is advantageous to sample at 1kHz because the rotor movement creates
vibration mainly at \(\sim\)70Hz, but also at the second and third harmonics thereof.
Hermansen should have been able to see this as he sampled at 200Hz, resulting in folding of the second and third
harmonic.

The measurement data is transformed into a packet where the leading bit of every byte contains a synchronization bit. When
the bit is set it signifies the start of a packet. These packets are then sent to the desktop machine at 1kHz. When the ultrasound 
sensor is not ready with a new measurement, zeroes are transmitted as its data
instead.
The packets are received on the desktop machine, which is running a control loop at 200Hz. Here the packets are unpacked to their
original form and corrupted packets are attempted detected and thrown away.
\subsection{Localisation}\label{sec:localisation}
Our localisation algorithm is a three step process. A flow diagram can be seen figure~\ref{fig:controlflow}.
First the rate gyroscope measurements are used to determine the orientation of
the arm. This is done using the Madgwick AHRS algorithm\cite{Madgwick2011}. It
is necessary to know the orientation of the arm before
the acceleration can be calculated because the acceleration measured by the tri-axis MEMs accelerometer is relative to the 
accelerometer frame. Additionally, gravity results in an offset in the accelerometer measurements that has constant magnitude, but
orientation varying with the orientation of the accelerometer. The acceleration
is then rotated into earth frame, the gravity vector is subtracted and the
vertical acceleration is isolated since we only care about the height of the arm.
This is then used as the control input to a static multi rate kalman filter\cite{Welch2006}.

Because the filter is static we
only predict the new state 
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k\vert k-1} = \mathbf{F}\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k-1\vert k-1} + \mathbf{B}a
\end{equation*}
Compute the measurement error 
\begin{equation*}
	y = z_k - \mathbf{H}\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k\vert k-1} 
\end{equation*}
And update the state
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k\vert k} = \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{k\vert k-1} + \mathbf{K} y
\end{equation*}

The kalman filter executes a predict step for every measurement coming from the accelerometer at 1kHz and an update step as soon 
as a measurement is received from the distance sensor, be it ultrasound or infrared. When using the IR distance 
sensor a measurement is always ready, however it is only updated at
\(\sim\)20Hz. With the ultrasound sensor, a measurement is only valid in the same sample it is recorded. The ultrasound sensor is also afflicted by intermittent noise that results in false readings,
typically far away from previous values. We employ a gating filter that culls out measurements too far from a moving average.

free reign to drift within that range. The noise in (b) is not measurement noise, but rapid oscillation.}

Let \(x_k\) be the current measurement sample, \(w\) the number of measurements taken into the moving average and \(Z\) the threshold value.
A measurement is then accepted if 
\begin{equation*}
	Z >\frac{1}{w} \left\lvert \sum_{i=k-w}^{k}x_i \right\rvert
\end{equation*}
This improves stability greatly as we rely somewhat heavily on the low frequency distance measurements in the kalman filter.
For the kalman filter we use the state space vector where the acceleration, velocity and position are perpendicular to the ground.
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{\mathbf{x}} = \begin{bmatrix}
		a_{off} \\
		v \\
		x
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
We include the term \(a_{off}\) because the accelerometer is not only affected by random noise with zero mean, but also a 
steady bias that depends on temperature as well as other factors. The \(a_{off}\) term is an offset that is modified along
with the velocity and position to yield a more accurate state estimation.
The state transition model where \(T\) is the sample period for the accelerometer.
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbf{F} = \begin{bmatrix}
		1 & 0 & 0 \\
		T & 1 & 0 \\
		0 & T & 1 
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Our control input model, where the control input is actually the acceleration, is.
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbf{B} = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 \\
		T \\
		0 
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
And since our measurements give us the absolute height of the arm the observation matrix becomes:
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbf{H} = \begin{bmatrix}
		0 \\
		0 \\
		1
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Because the kalman filter is static, we need different kalman gains when using the potentiometer (P), ultrasound sensor (ult) and IR sensor (IR).
We have determined the following kalman gains by manual tuning.
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbf{K}_{ult} = \begin{bmatrix}
		0.025 \\
		0.075 \\
		0.0625
	\end{bmatrix}, \quad
	\mathbf{K}_{IR} = \begin{bmatrix}
		0.025 \\
		0.075 \\
		0.0625
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
The potentiometer requires more aggressive gain constants when sampled at lower frequencies. We use the following kalman gains for 1Hz
and 20Hz sampling frequencies. 
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbf{K}_{P,1} = \begin{bmatrix}
		0.25 \\
		0.75 \\
		0.625 
	\end{bmatrix},\quad
	\mathbf{K}_{P,20} = \begin{bmatrix}
		0.025 \\
		0.075 \\
		0.0625
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}

The output from the kalman filter is used to contruct a full one dimensional state estimate in the form
\begin{equation*}
	{\mathbf{x}}_{est} = \begin{bmatrix}
		x \\
		v \\
		a
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
Where \(x\) is the estimated height, \(v\) the velocity along the vertical axis and \(a\) the acceleration along the vertical axis. 
This state estimate is then used with an LQR controller to compute the control output for the motor.
\subsection{Controller}\label{sec:controller}
We employ a static LQR controller with the following gain constants:
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbf{K}_{LQR} = \begin{bmatrix}
		1000 \\
		275 \\
		0 
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
such that the output $u$ is given by:
\begin{equation*}
u = \mathbf x _{est}^{\mbox T}\mathbf K_{LQR} + u_{off}
\end{equation*}
where $u_{off}$ is an offset given to counter the effect of gravity on the lever
arm.

The controller is essentially a PD controller since it uses only the current position and the derivative thereof, velocity, to calculate
the next control signal.
